GitHub Authenticator
About the Authenticator:
This is a TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) authenticator for GitHub. It generates temporary 6-digit codes that change every 30 seconds, providing an extra layer of security for your account.

Why use it?
When you enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on GitHub, in addition to your regular password, you need to provide a temporary code to prove that you are really you. This authenticator generates these codes directly in your browser, without the need to install external applications like Authy or Google Authenticator.

When setting up 2FA on GitHub:

1. GitHub will display a secret code or a full TOTP URL

2. Paste any of the formats below (the program detects it automatically):

Direct code: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (code provided by GitHub)
Full URL: otpauth://totp/GitHub:username?secret=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&issuer=GitHub
3. Click "Set up" and the authenticator will generate the codes for login
